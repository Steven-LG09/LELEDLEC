# 🔗 Linked List Examples – Simple, Doubly & Circular

This project contains practical implementations of three types of **linked lists**:  
**Singly Linked List**, **Doubly Linked List**, and **Circular Linked List**.  
It's aimed at helping learners understand the structure and logic behind each variant.

## 🧠 What’s Included

- ✅ Singly Linked List  
- ✅ Doubly Linked List  
- ✅ Circular Linked List  
- Basic operations: insertion, deletion, display

## 💡 Purpose

These examples are educational and can be used to:
- Understand how linked lists work
- Practice data structures in Python 
- Use as a base for more advanced algorithms

## 🛠️ Technologies / Languages Used

-  Python 

## 📦 “The data structures you master today are the tools you'll build empires with tomorrow.”
